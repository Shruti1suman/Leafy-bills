# Leafy Bills
Our plant store, "Leafy Bills," digitalises billing processes. Currently, our handwritten invoices are prone to errors and inefficiencies. We require a software tool that can generate accurate and professional bills for our customers quickly and efficiently.
# Resources: 
HTML/CSS/JavaScript for frontend, PDF generation library (e.g., PDFKit)
features:
Automate Billing: The application should automate the process of generating bills for customers purchasing plants from our store.
Ease of Use: The software should be user-friendly, allowing our staff to input customer information and purchased items easily.
Save and Print: Enable the option to save bills for records and print them for customers
Charity Donation Option: Include an
option for customers to round up their
total to donate to a plant conservation
or environmental charity.
